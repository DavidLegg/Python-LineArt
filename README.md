LineArt - Python Automatic Drawing
==================================

This is a small project to explore the ability for simple scripts to create abstract art by drawing curves that are constrained and randomized in different ways.

Usage
-----

Use the quick method from main.py, passing a Drawing class. Then, click on the resulting window to get a drawing produced by the default settings for that class.

You can also pass settings to the quick method to tweak the appearance of this drawing.

To combine drawing classes, create your own class that inherits from each desired type of Drawing. Passing arguments to parameters will still work.

A deeper dive into the interface is given in 'Interface.md'.
